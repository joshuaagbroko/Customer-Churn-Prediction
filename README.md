This repository contains a customer churn analysis project using logistic regression and LASSO regression. The project involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and visualization in Tableau.

## Project Overview

  Objective: Predict customer churn and identify key drivers.

  Dataset: Customer churn dataset containing demographic, service, and contract details.

  Methods Used:

      Logistic Regression

      LASSO Regression for feature selection

      Model Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall


## Results & Insights

  - The model achieved 94.01% accuracy, with a balanced accuracy of 92.58%.

  - Tenure, Internet Service, and Churn Score were significant predictors of churn.

  - Customers with month-to-month contracts had the highest churn rate.
